# 2D-MOT-Simulation-for-Lithium-6
Framework to simulate behavior of ⁶Li atoms in a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D MOT).

## Branches

- **main** — immutable snapshot of the repository at the time the Master’s thesis was handed in. This branch reflects the exact code, configuration and results included in the submission.
- **develop** — active development branch intended for ongoing improvements (GUI, features, tests, documentation). New work should be done on feature branches (e.g. `feature/gui`, `fix/seed-sampling`) and merged into `develop` via pull requests. Periodic releases or stable snapshots can be merged back into `main` or tagged as release versions.
